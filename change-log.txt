0.2.0
More subtools added such as:
qualdist,winner,pct2d,uncalled
-- winner is from poretools, but I enabled a type called "each" to give winners for each read type and an option called --details to only give lengths, not sequence.
-- pct2d goes through all reads in a dir and returns % that have 2D sequences
-- uncalled goes through a dir, finds files that are not base-called and either reports them or moves them to a different dir
Warning: I only work on poreminion every once in a while and some tools are un-finished and/or broken.
Current tools I know to work are:
	- data_conc
	- qualpos
	- qualdist
	- kmer
	- kmerplot 
	- kmerdiff
	- winner
	- pct2d
	- uncalled
	- numevents
The 'align' subtool is something I tooled with, which was just going to be a wrapper over various aligners. I believe it is not in working order.
Others such as events_stats, get_events, get_model, get_metadata are also un-finished. I have similar functions in another suite that I will make available soon.
